# 1. Philosophy
Flutter's philosophy of coding is focused on delivering a high degreee of performance by: **Widgets, Animations and Hot reload**, to surport the high level of productivity.

First all, Flutter is all about Widgets and Fast.
Widgets give devs the ability to ceate UI elements in a short time with a maximum of quality to users, based on UI, visilization

Flutter is more than a SDK, a super framework instead of language.

## 1.1. Widgets: Everything is widget
surport devlopers to create a pretty and customise application in a short time.

- Each widget has its own layout model with simple rules and structure.
- Since each widget does not require any sophisticated models and any kind of underlying platform-specific components or long-run lists of rules, a layout can be heavily optimized.
- If you turn almost all objects into widgets, the layout can be simplified even further.
These princples lied in the core of Flutter philosophy and helped the team to create an easy-to-understand SDK, which is widely applied to build apps that look and feel as native on any platform, screen and device.

## 1.2. Hot reload
Hot reload allows developers to see in real-time all changes they have made to an application.

## 1.3. Animations
Animations help devlopers to create a complex and attractive application in less time.
